# Scope

What v0 covers (single-spin Larmor precession under static B)

What is explicitly out of scope (DQD, exchange coupling, decoherence)

# Model & equations (short)

Hamiltonian you use

What observables you plot (⟨σx⟩, ⟨σy⟩, ⟨σz⟩)

# Assumptions

Static B field

Closed-system unitary evolution (no Lindblad/noise) for v0

# References

Links to 1–3 core references (textbook section / lecture notes / a key paper)

Keep it as citations + your own paraphrase (avoid copying long text)

# Decisions log

“Why I chose this v0 first”

“Why this output format (plot + metrics.json)”

# Open questions / Parking lot

Items you’ll revisit later (e.g., two-spin Hamiltonian, exchange term, Lindblad)
